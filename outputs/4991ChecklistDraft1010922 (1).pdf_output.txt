Capstone checklist for standards, sustainability, health & safety and legal.
Absence, or insufficient completion, of this checklist will result in the rejection of the proposal or report.
Please use this checklist as a guide to help you express these topics in your reports, and to summarize them.
This checklist must be completed in full by each capstone team member and submitted with the final project
proposal (Capstone !) and final project report (Capstone I). Where appropriate, responses should relate to your
sub-system and area of responsibility. Write full sentences; simply answering “yes” or “no” will not be accepted.

Project Title: Invoice Processing and Classification Project Date: 15/12/2024
System with OCR and Named Entity Recognition code:1010922
Provide a brief overview of your project
The capstone project, created through teamwork, focuses on reducing manual data entry and boosting
operational efficiency by leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. This initiative aims to
address the growing challenges of inefficiencies and inaccuracies in managing invoices, which have become
more pressing as businesses face an increasing number of invoices and evolving product usage conditions. By
utilizing advanced technologies like OCR and Named Entity Recognition (NER), the project seeks to improve
data extraction, classification, and processing while minimizing the need for human intervention. The system
includes key features such as the ability to upload invoices in different formats, batch processing options, and
user-friendly interfaces.
Part A - Overview
1. What are the main functional and performance requirements of your product or sub-system?
*Supports PDF and JPG file formats, enabling batch uploads of invoices.
*Utilizes OCR technology for text extraction, aiming for an accuracy rate of at least 85%.
*Categorizes invoices into predefined groups (such as sales, purchase, proforma).
*Extracts essential information (including vendor name, invoice date, total amount, etc.).
*Guarantees secure storage in accordance with GDPR and KVKK regulations.
2. What are the dominant design constraints for your product or sub-system?
*Supports the English language.
*Offers a scalable solution for processing a large volume of invoices.
*Ensures compliance with GDPR and other legal regulations.
3. Who will be the users of your product?
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and accounting departments are increasingly looking to
implement automation.
4. What realistic operating conditions have you assumed your product will be exposed to?
*Efficiently handling substantial volumes of invoices in under ten seconds each.
*Reliable operation with an annual uptime of no less than 99.5%.

5. Other.
Integration with current enterprise resource planning (ERP) and accounting systems to facilitate smooth
workflow automation.
Part B - Standards
1. What safety standards apply to your product or sub-system? For example, ISO.
ISO/IEC 27001 is a standard for managing information security. |
2. Are there any basic standards (legal metrology) that apply to your product or sub-system?
Compliance with GDPR and KVKK for the safeguarding of data and the privacy of users. |
3. Are there any performance standards that apply to your product or sub-system?
*The accuracy benchmarks for OCR exceed 85%.
*The classification accuracy surpasses 95%.
4. Are there any codes {government laws) that apply to your product or sub-system
Compliance with electronic invoicing standards is essential in both domestic and international markets.
5. Other.
User verification and access management should be based on roles to ensure security. |
Part C - Economic impacts
1. Explain how you minimized the cost of your prototype, and how production costs could be reduced if the
prototype were to be mass produced?
*Used open-source libraries like Tesseract OCR and BERT to reduce prototype costs.
*The ability to scale for mass production ensures cost savings through economies of scale.
2. Compared to other similar products that are on the market, how does your design lead to cost savings for
the user?
Automation reduces the costs linked to manual labor. Faster processing speeds save time in operations
and help boost overall efficiency.
3. Would there be any tax incentives to be considered towards final product cost. For example, renewable
energy and energy-efficient products tax incentives, carbon footprint reduction, etc.
Eligibility for renewable energy and sustainability tax credits may arise from reduced reliance on physical
invoices.
4. Are there any environmental aspects, such as availability of resources that may affect the product cost and
therefore price and market vulnerability?
Cutting down on paper use contributes to sustainability objectives and reduces material expenses.
5. Other.
There are minimal infrastructure requirements for deployment. |

Part D - Environmental impact
1. Are there any greenhouse gas emissions related to the production or use of your product, what aspects of
your design attempts to reduce those emissions?
Emissions have been reduced thanks to a lesser dependence on physical documents and a stronger focus
on digital processing.
2. Does your product require usage of environmentally sensitive resources such as water, energy, wood, etc.
and how does your design encourage efficient use of such resources?
Decreased consumption of paper and energy in conventional invoice management practices. |
3. Does your product rely on materials or resources that scarce (such as rare elements)? Has your design been
adapted to make use of materials that are more abundant?
System development is not dependent on scarce materials; it emphasizes the use of readily accessible
resources.
4. Does your product introduce or encourage different usage or behaviors that are more environmentally
friendly?
There is a significant movement towards embracing digital processes and transitioning away from paper-
based operations.
5. Other
Using storage efficiently can contribute to lowering energy consumption. |
Part E - Social impact
1. In what way can your product impact people's lives (positively and negatively)? What design decisions have
you made to maximize positive impact and minimize negative impact.
Positive Impact: Alleviates the burden on employees, enhances operational efficiency.
Negative Impact: Possible elimination of manual data entry positions.
2. Does your product address any social needs?
Automates routine tasks, enabling employees to concentrate on more strategic initiatives. |
3. Who will benefit from this product?
Small and medium-sized enterprises, accounting specialists, and entities dedicated to digital
transformation.
4. 1f your product were to be mass-produced, would it create new jobs, or destroy jobs?
